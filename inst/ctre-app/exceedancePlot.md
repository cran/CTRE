### The POT (Peaks over Threshold) model

(_Set the minimum threshold height to at least 120._) 
A standard modelling tool for extremes is the POT model, see e.g. 
the book "An Introduction to Statistical Modelling of Extreme Values" 
by Coles, 2001. 

Compared to the second panel, now the parameters of the Generalized 
Pareto distribution are fitted to magnitudes (minus threshold) for 
varying threshold heights. 

The plots below are created with `tcplot()` from the 
[`evmix` R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/evmix/index.html).
